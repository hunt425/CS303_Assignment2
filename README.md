# CS303_Assignment2
#For this assignment we were to create a parent class (employees) and 2 derived classes for professional and non professional workers. The difference between the salary and wage workers for this assignment is form of payment, vacation hours, and health insurance taken from pay checks. Professional workers getpaid salary, get 10 vacation hours for every 4 weeks they work, and have 10% of their paycheck taken each week. The non professional workers get paid by hourly wage, get 5 vacation hours every 4 weeks, and get 5% taken from their pay checks each week
#For this assignment I created two instances (Martha and Thomas), one from each derived class initialization to disply their name, current bank account amount, vacation hours, health insurance money, and earnings.
#To change the variables of the code you can change the values in the instances of each class (Martha and Thomas), other than that the rest of the code is mostly automatic. The code stops at the end of each "work week" to display the information (changed from the functions in the Functions.cpp file) to ask the user if they want to see the next weeks information.
